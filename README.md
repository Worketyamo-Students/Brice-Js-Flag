This is a website built with html, css and js which help user view the flag of a country(Cameroon, Senegal, Guinea and Japan) when they enter the name of the country in the prompt that pops up.
This was initially to learn how to trigger tags using the keyword **document** to alter the design of a tag either by it **id**, it **classname** and even with the name of the **tag**.
